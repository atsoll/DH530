    <h3>Introducing the Aspen Movement</h3>
    <p class="para">Throughout modern history, successful movements have rarely achieved their goals through bureaucratic means. Policy is incremental and subject to changing political whims. Significant societal change on human rights and equity issues requires a united movement with public support to challenge the status quo, to reveal the possibilities and promise of ushering in a new order. </p>
    <p class="para">The Canadian film sector has, for decades, remained stagnant on gender equity. As detailed in this report, policy to improve the gender balance across the sector has been scant and ineffective. At the same time, women’s movements are finding success across the world with concerted and creative protest. This report outlines several effective women’s strikes that have achieved various political, social, and economic goals. </p>
    <p class="para">When policy doesn’t work, when it’s not the right tool for the task, communities experiencing inequality and oppression have an opportunity to take control. In the case of the Canadian film sector, women and gender nonbinary folks who have fought to claim a small portion of jobs and power have an opportunity to take control by building anew. Thus, we propose a new Canadian film industry built from the ground up with equity at its centre.</p>
    <p class="para">We conceptualize this movement as a regrowth from the ashes of a failed system. When forest fires happen in the Canadian boreal forest, Aspen trees are among the first species to regrow. Aspen is the most widely distributed tree in North America and they are unique in their ability to regenerate through shoots and suckers from its long lateral roots. We believe that aspens are the perfect metaphor for this movement. Well-placed, resourceful, quick to regrow, and regal.</p>

    <h3>Defining the Problem and Lack of Solution</h3>
    <p class="para">In 2017 women received 31.1% of directing contracts for Canadian films, a 2.9% increase from 2016. The writing contracts saw a similar jump, from 28.2% to 34.1%. In Western Canada the total number of female led projects receiving funding rose from 20% in 2016 to 28.6% in 2017. </p>
    <p class="para">But in the same time frame, the identical measure dropped from 60 to 50% in Atlantic Canada. The portion of total cinematography contracts awarded to women went from from 14.6% to 6.8%. The fraction of TV series having not a single female director increased from 45 in 2013 to 59% in 2017. Between 2015 and 2017, the presence of Indigenous women in the canadian screen industry passed <i>“from insignificant to negligible.”</i></p>
    <p class="para">A <a href="https://cmpa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/CMPA-Women-and-Leadership-2017-01-30.pdf" target="blank">report</a> released by the Canadian Media Producers Association (CMPA) in 2015 enumerated what the 561 industry member respondents to their survey perceived as being the most significant barriers to increasing diversity in the Canadian screen industry. Chief among the concerns were difficulty in obtaining funding for larger projects, not being recognized for their accomplishments, and pay equity. When segmented by career stage, the mid career women were the most likely to feel as though they faced particular obstacles due to their gender. However, it appears that the conceptualization of the solution clashed with the realities; in the same survey, an overwhelming majority felt that “hard work and talent”  were what allowed women leaders to overcome obstacles faced, over and above formalised industry campaigns. Therein lies one of the key difficulties of diversifying the screen industry: despite ample research detailing the systematic oppression of underrepresented populations, those very populations are lulled into thinking that a little more hard work will do the trick. So deeply entrenched in a flawed system, they can’t see the forest for the trees.</p>
    <h4 class="subtitle">The State of the Field (or forest, perhaps)</h4>
    <p class="para">A survey of international screen industry diversity focused literature reveals a unilateral focus in increasing female presence at the top levels - in ‘key’ creative roles. While the term designates a slightly different set of positions in each context - including, for example, the protagonist in australia - it generally refers to the top tier decision makers: the producer, the writer, the director, and, with reduced frequency, the cinematographer. The <a href="http://womeninview.ca/wp-content/uploads/WIVOS19-Full-Report.pdf" target="blank">2019 report</a> released by Women in View on Screen (WIVOS) makes a compelling case for the assumption underlying this approach that women will more frequently collaborate with other women. Dubbed the ‘Producer Effect’ - the ‘Showrunner Effect’ for television - their statistics demonstrate that projects with a woman at the help tended to boast a higher overall proportion of women in key creative roles: 23% to 53% for television and 19.3% to 34.5% for film; this latter jumped to 66.7% when a woman of colour was in the top spot (2017 data). The proposed solutions consequently take a top down approach, presuming a trickle down effect.</p>
    <p class="para">In concordance both with international trends and with survey responses in which less than half of respondents indicated that existing industry mentorship programs and existing diversity and gender policies and programs were useful in helping women leaders to overcome challenges - the former discredited even further by the fact that in the same question, the support of a boss or professional mentor was rated as being very important - the action plans put forward by both canadian reports centered around new measures focused on employment quotas or targets, and equal distribution of funding.</p>
    <p class="para">Despite the stigma attached to quotas, respondents to the CMPA survey expressed the opinion that without quotas it would be impossible to institute change. Additionally, both Canadian reports cited <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/cbc-tv-female-directors-boost-1.3632637" target="blank">CBC’s commitment to director gender parity</a> as one of the most successful actions in recent memory. With respect to terminology, WIVOS, in a similar vein to the swedes, styled their recommendation as not a quota but an “aspirational benchmark”, but the principle is still the same - just as in the Australian <a href="https://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/sa/media-centre/backgrounders/2019/08-14-gender-matters-2019" target="blank"> Gender Matters</a> project, they are looking to <i>“unashamedly provid[e] express-lane access to female business ideas and stories”</i>. They are not building from the ground up but parachuting in diversity at the highest level.</p>
    <p class="para">The other common thread to emerge - from CMPA, from WIVOS, from <a href="https://realisatrices-equitables.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/rapport-la-place-des-creatrices-12-juin-2016.pdf" target="blank">Réalisatrices Equitables</a> - was the call for 50/50 allocation of public funds, it even being selected by the CMPA survey respondents as the initiative most likely to have a positive impact on gender imbalance. With respect to the global situation, this is well founded given that it is the heart of the diversity initiatives of the Swedish film board, which were touted as highly successful.</p>
    <p class="para">There is one small problem, however. By the Swedes’ own admission, they weren’t.</p>
    <h4 class="subtitle">The Arithmetic Sublime </h4>
    <p class="para">The numbers are a measure of success, but what are they measuring exactly? Is it the same as what they're perceived to be measuring?</p>
    <p class="para">The <a href="https://www.filminstitutet.se/globalassets/_dokument/rapporter/swedish-film-insitute-gender-equality-report_2017_eng.pdf" target="blank">2017 gender equity report</a> released by the Swedish film institute pinpointed with ease the the problem with numbers: <i>“According to feminist research, it is important to look at exactly what conditions different gender equality initiatives lead to for women, rather than just at how the number of women has increased.“</i></p>
    <p class="para">Nowhere is this more obvious than in the figures surrounding funding.</p>
    <p class="para">Ignoring the process, funding based metrics depended on the outcome, the success of a film being based on its revenue, and much of the reticence around funding female lead projects is founded on the fear of financial loss at the hands of untested women. The motivating idea behind equal funding allocation is to create equal opportunity, but ignored is the fact that equal funding does not mean equal situations.</p>
    <p class="para">Echoing the findings of several other bodies, the WIVOS analysis showed that an increase in the number of funded female-led projects was not accompanied by a correspondingly large increase in the percent of funding allocated to the same project class. This dovetails with the consistent and widespread exclusion of female led projects from the highest funding brackets.</p>
    <p class="para">The other notable disparity is in hiring and crediting. Despite their own admission that a credit is the most important thing to career advancement, the <a href="http://womeninview.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Women-In-View-On-Screen-2015.pdf" target="blank">2015 WIVOS data</a> reveals that only 11% of female television directors employed were actually credited. Any increase in the credits granted to women, in the outcomes,  is viewed as a success, those numbers brought to the forefront, but these secondary figures would suggest that men’s work is still overwhelmingly privileged in the process.</p>
    <h4 class="subtitle">We Can’t Fix It (so let’s burn it)</h4>
    <p class="para">Ignored by those who continue to use it as a model for screen industry reform, the 2017 Swedish report comes to a harrowing conclusion:</p>
    <p class="para"><i>“There are different value systems that need to be united, where quality should not be synonymous with men, but quality in film should be independent of who has the opportunity to make it. <b>Because we do not believe that the structures in actual fact have changed in a way that’s sustainable in the long term.</b>”</i></p>
    <p class="para">Values systems are a foundation - and buildings aren’t built top down.</p>
    <p class="para"><i>“One problem that has manifested is that <b>gender equality has come to be placed in opposition to the values that permeate the rest of film policy</b>”</i></p>
    <p class="para">The current top down policies imply that the problem is a lack of women in positions of power, when truly it is a lack of space for women. A few token women parachuted in isn’t going to solve years of systematic oppression - their power is limited by a decades old system as deeply  entrenched in the ‘old boys club’ mentality as any Engineering faculty.</p>
    <p class="para">This representation of the problem stems from trying to shoehorn growing societal expectations of gender equality into an existing - and strict - framework. In an industry where capitalism is king, the seemingly natural way to measure gender equality was through concrete and measurable outcomes. The effect this has is to measure existence of women but not the nature of their inclusion, when it is the latter that in truth dictates the former;  as stated by WOVIS in 2015:  <i>“What’s important to note is the way these patterns of exclusion and under-investment re-inforce each other.”</i></p>
    <p class="para">The underlying assumption is that women will support other women. There is enough evidence to suggest some truth to this yet, working within the current system, adding more women at the top hasn’t improved things significantly. So let’s remove the system.</p>
    <p class="para">In an interview on the Podcast <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/%C3%A9pisode-bonus-la-france-et-les-f%C3%A9minismes/id1172772210?i=1000468171692&l=fr" target="blank">La Poudre</a>, sociologist Aurore Kochelin laments the decoupling of feminism in France from Marxism, frustrated that resformist policy focused strategies have been brought to the forefront of the modern feminist movement, its rebellious roots too often overlooked, forgotten or invisiblised. However, she does express some hope with regard to the massive feminsit mobilizations of recent years - in latin america in 2015, on a global scale with #metoo - the return of rebellion, of the power of the many.
Time and time again the data showed that there was no lack of talent; the WIVOS 2017 report boldly stated that there is a sufficient pool of talent to go 50:50 immediately, were such a dramatic shift possible. And what would happen if it were? </p>
    <p class="para">The most significant disruption to policy is its dissolution, its destruction: an ‘un-policy’, if you will.</p>

    <h3>Looking to Women’s Strikes for an Alternative</h3>
    <h4 class="subtitle">Striking as Feminist Tactic</h4>
    <p class="para">Feminst movements have a solid history of nonviolent protest to achieve equity goals, from turn of the century suffragettes to the 'bra burners' of the 60s to today’s #metoo and Black Lives Matter movements. When the seat of power is held by those who are accustomed to the world operating in their favour, it is rare for social progress to happen easily. Creative nonviolent protest is a tool to draw attention to inequities, build community, engender empathy, and make it uncomfortable for the powerful to retain the status quo. Nonviolent movements are powerful because they are a choreography of people for whom change is imperative -- and personal. Angela Davis wrote in <i>Freedom is a Constant Struggle: Ferguson, Palestine, and the Foundations of a Movement</i>, <i>“I don't think we can rely on governments, regardless of who is in power, to do the work that only mass movements can do.”</i></p>
    <p class="para">When government policy isn’t working, as in the case of the Canadian film industry, nonviolent protest can coalesce affected people to voice demands that are louder and clearer than the bureaucratic and private arenas where lobbying and policy making take place. For decades, women facing a range of discrimination and violence have used strikes, the withdrawl of labour, to raise the stakes on important issues of equity. There is a clear precedent for success with nonviolent strikes in the movement for gender equality. Several specific cases are detailed here. </p>
    <h4 class="subtitle">Iceland | 1975, 1985, 2005, 2010, 2016, and 2018</h4>
    <p class="para">One of the most successful women’s strikes took place on October 24, 1975. In response to growing frustration about the 40% gender pay gap in the country, organizers planned a <a href="https://icelandmag.is/article/1975-womens-strike-when-90-icelandic-women-went-strike-protest-gender-inequality" target="blank">'day off'</a> strike-like event where women would not go to work and not do unpaid housework. It is estimated that more than <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2019/10/iceland-redstockings-womens-strike-feminism" target="blank">90% of women participated in the action,</a> including 25,000 women - about half of all women in the city - who congregated in downtown Reykjavík. In 1976, Iceland passed a law banning wage discrimation on the basis of gender (Iceland Mag). In 1980, Iceland became the first country to democratically elect a female president and in 2016, 47.6% of their elected members of Parliament were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/16/opinion/politics/johanna-sigurdardottir-give-women-a-chance.html" target="blank">women</a> Since 1975, there have been five more women’s strikes in Iceland leading to sustained awareness of gender equality issues. The country today has an <i>“image as a front-runner in gender equality”</i> (<a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2019/10/iceland-redstockings-womens-strike-feminism" target="blank">Jacobin</a>).</p>

    <h4 class="subtitle">Poland | 2016 and 2018</h4>
    <p class="para">In deeply conservative Poland, the ruling Law and Justice Party introduced legislation in 2016 to further limit already strict abortion laws, effectively banning all abortions including those resulting from rape and those where fetal health is compromised. Women’s rights organizers coalesced around a <a href="" target="blank">#BlackProtest</a>, encouraging women to wear black and post their protest on social media, and to strike on October 3 wearing black. More than 150,000 women rallied in 140 cities and towns across the country.The tactics worked, and the bill was pulled two days later (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/world/europe/poland-abortion-women-protest.html" target="blank">NYT</a>).The Black Protests became the <a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/03/poland-black-protests-womens-strike-abortion-pis" target="blank">only citizen movement </a>to win a victory against the Law and Justice Party. Their success inspired other Polish people to take to the streets in protest of “the ecological disaster in the Białowieża primeval forest, air pollution, the courts’ dependence on executive power, fascist demonstrations, and the government’s violations of labor rights” (Jacobin). Two years later, the Law and Justice Party reintroduced the full abortion bad legislation and women again took to the streets in a Black Protest (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/world/europe/poland-abortion-women-protest.html" target="blank">NYT</a>).</p>

    <h4 class="subtitle">Mexico | 2020</h4>
    <p class="para">On March 9, millions of women in Mexico participated in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-women-antiviolence-latinamerica/a-day-without-women-strikes-in-mexico-follow-huge-rallies-idUSKBN20W0KQ" target="blank">'a day without us'</a>,  a national women’s strike to protest a shocking 137% rise in femicide in five years. In Mexico, about <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/09/813699719/mexican-women-stay-home-to-protest-femicides-in-a-day-without-us" target="blank">10 women are killed each day</a> and the country’s femicide rate has grown at four times the pace of its national murder rate. Many companies, as well as the government, gave women a paid day off for the protest; the national Chamber of Commerce estimated that the absence of women from the workforce for one day cost the country the equivalent of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/09/813699719/mexican-women-stay-home-to-protest-femicides-in-a-day-without-us" target="blank">a billion dollars US.</a>  The protest wasn’t entirely nonviolent as some protestors in Santiago <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/20/argentina-women-south-america-marches-violence-ni-una-menos" target="blank">clashed</a> with police and with fascist anti-abortion protestors. In this case, the tactic of a women’s strike is particularly poignant because it is drawing attention to what a world without women would look like in order to raise awareness about the absence of so many women due to femicide. The tactic has been used in several Latin American countries dealing with the same femicide rise; Argentina’s 'not one less' protest in 2016 set off a wave of demonstrations in neighbouring countries.</p>

    <h4 class="subtitle">Adapting Strike History for the Aspen Movement</h4>
    <p class="para">Many of the examples above are also allied with the International Women’s Strike, a global coordination of annual women’s strikes that has been in operation since 2017 and was largely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/iceland-global-womens-strike-protest" target="blank">organized</a> by Polish women who found success with their BlackProtest demonstrations.</p>
    <p class="para">However, as one organizer acknowledged in an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/08/iceland-global-womens-strike-protest" target="blank">opinion piece</a> for The Guardian, <i>“Today, the idea of women massively withdrawing labour, waged and unwaged, is not a reality yet.”</i> There are many economic and social reasons why women can’t participate in strikes, even though those conditions are part of the oppressive system that is being protested.</p>
    <p>Our solution takes this into consideration. We do not propose action that involves withdrawing labour entirely, or sacrificing financial earnings. Rather, we propose shifting the labour of women, nonbinary folks, and allied men to create a new sector, built from scratch with principles of equity and fairness at its core. It’s not a strike; it’s new growth.</p>

    <h3>Our Proposed Plan of Action</h3>
    <h4 class="subtitle">Clearing the Forest</h4>
    <p class="para">As our list of policy failures demonstrates, previous interventions have been less than effective in addressing inequality in the Canadian film industry. "Producer Effects," hiring quotas, and better female funding and crediting assume that trickle-down effects will bring diversity to the industry, but this will not correct a system whose very structure is committed to kyriarchal domination. To date, policies aimed at improving equality for women in the industry have failed to adequately account for the network effects of pre-existing, "old boys" linkages, and have used the number of women working in industry to obscure the actual conditions of their labour. Though we do have precedent to believe that women will support other women, merely an increase in funding for female-led projects has not brought about fair and equal treatment of finished projects; nor has improved female-crediting brought about an equal distribution of creative labour. As the 2017 CMPA survey makes clear, men's work remains overrepresented, overpaid, and over-recognized.</p>
    <p class="para">Because inequality is all-too-commonly perpetuated by well-meaning but complicit men (men who are often unaware of how deep-seated their complicity runs) our intervention proposes to do away with the old network entirely. Rather than relying on ineffective policies, small-scale pledges, and glacial cultural shifts to effect change, we propose a new Canadian film industry built from the ground up with equity at its centre. Informed by the notable examples of successful movements above, we suggest the following order of operations:</p>
    <h4 class="subtitle">Lighting the Match</h4>
    <p class="para">Women from our examples who were involved in successful striking, commonly remarked that what they felt made their movements successful was the solidarity and awareness they raised. Rather than coming from a committee or from broken policy imposed from the outside, success was the result of ordinary people with deep, personal knowledge of their own corner of the network, coming together under a common banner and seeing the potential influence of their collective power. While we do not suggest that women are responsible for the terrible, current state of the Canadian film industry or that a lack of collective action is the cause of its continuation, we do suggest that withholding labour, however briefly, can be a transformative and mobilizing experience when done together, constituting many, simultaneous, <a href="https://deb-verhoeven.s3.amazonaws.com/chapters/ShowMetheHistory.pdf" target="blank">'big data' moments</a> where the sheer scale of a problem and the possibility of a solution become apparent. Writing on <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22767921" target="blank">social network interventions</a> confirms that leaders heavily invested in the status quo cannot be relied upon to bring about necessary change, and that in such a case, it is leaderless network interventions that are most likely to be successful. Women striking has a strong historical precedent for achieving success, and so we defer to this wisdom.</p>

    <p class="para">While the exact shape of collective action sparked by initial striking is hard to predict, it is our hope and belief that striking will facilitate the beginnings of a film industry "shadow network" that will eventually replace the Canadian film industry. 2017 CMPA survey respondents felt that the support of a boss or mentor was an important step in achieving gender equality in the industry; we suggest that an initial strike (when the match is lit) is when such relationships can begin to form. Over time, these informal relationships could crystallize into formal ones, with each woman-identified or nonbinary individual in the network paired with at least one mentor and at least one mentee. Drawing again on the 2017 Swedish Gender Equity report, and on the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/yale-sexual-assault-allegations-2018-1" target="blank">history</a> of successful <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/business/sexual-harassment-whisper-network.html" target="blank">covert mobilization</a> believe that women, once they see each other, can be counted upon to support other women. These initial mentor/mentee relationships will become the groundwork for what will eventually replace the current film industry network.</p>
    <h4 class="subtitle">Shaping a New Forest...</h4>
    <p class="para">Our goal is not to get lost in the business of prediction (and miss the forest for the trees, so to speak), but if the New Film Industry is going to survive, eventually an organizational structure must form. What that structure will look like is a messy question we leave to the trailblazing women and nonbinary folks who naturally emerge as leaders in this movement, and so we offer just one ambition: that the New Film Industry not reproduce the very systemic injustices and structural inequalities that make the current one dispensable. An industry driven by "white feminism" and lacking in intersectional consideration would only need tearing down again. While the focus of this project has been on improving the representation of women in the Canadian film industry, this is a function of the limited data we have to work with. (Such is the nature of data.) We would hope that whatever (un)policies, directives, goals, and modes the New Film Industry chooses to enact, formally or informally, they would keep liberation and equality as their primary impulses.</p>
    <h4 class="subtitle">...and Smoking Out the Old One</h4>
    <p class="para">In order to make room for the new forest, it is necessary to kill off the old one. The aim here, of course, is not to do away with the men working in industry but the apparatus in which they dominate, and which facilitates their domination. The old-boys clubs, the directors who won't work with women, the all-white casts, the all-male writers' rooms—these have to go. It will not be enough to build a New Film Industry within our current capitalist economy if the old one is alive to compete. These old relationships must die.</p>
    <p class="para">An example of how this death might happen: a seemingly innocuous accreditation process, whereby studios provide proof of their equal distribution of creative (and non-creative) labour, and the award for their work is the right to distribution. This "right" would not be governmentally but socially sanctioned, exerting the same pressure that was used to bring about the conviction of Harvey Weinstein and the industry-wide adoption of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-intimacy-coordinators-are-changing-the-way-intimate-encounters-are-filmed/" target="blank">intimacy coordinators</a>. By sewing disdain for (and eventually outright boycotting) non-accredited productions, and with women and nonbinary folks shifting their labour away from such productions (imagine the dread of filming heterosexual sex scenes without women!), the old industry would slowly but surely die off. Movie theatres, film distributors, studios, and individuals would cave under the collective pressure.</p>
    <p class="para">Let's flip the script. Instead of women fighting for creative roles, funding, and recognition, let's make the men come to us.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <h4 class="subtitle">Imagining a New Forest</h4>
    <p class="para">The call for greater diversity in the Canadian film sector, the belief in its potential for success, and the reasoning behind many of the proposed changes came in part from <i>“niches where gender parity and greater diversity exist [which] offer the wider industry important clues on achieving equity at an accelerated pace.”</i> (WOVIS 2017) When women are allowed to work together, even within the confines of the system, they do so differently from the network as a whole - less exclusively, more collaboratively, more <b>together</b>.</p>
    <p class="para">In examining film sector networks from three different countries - Germany, Sweden, and Australia - we find that these differences are reflected numerically. With the exception of volume, the gender seperated networks appear similar, acting merely as further evidence for the feasibility of separation. However, there do exist some structural differences that suggest fundamental differences in operation.</p>
    <p class="para">Across the board, the women’s networks have significantly higher density. This measure, which adjusts for graph size, suggests - in light of the fact that weights were discarded - that each individual in the network works with a much wider circle of people than is the case with the men. What’s more, the clustering coefficients are greater for the men’s graphs. The lower tendency for clustering among the women coupled with the higher density implies a wider and more varied sort of collaboration. Finally, with the exception of Australia, where the numbers were nearly on par, the gap between the maximum and averaged normalized betweenness centralities is globally lower for the women’s networks, suggesting a more balanced network flow.</p>
